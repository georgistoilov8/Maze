Hi, thank you for buying the 14 segment display ! Here is some documentation on how it works, and how to use it.

You will find 4 prefabs ready to use in the package:

- digit:
	The main asset. It is a model, made of a background and 14 parts. A script named "Digit" is attached to it.
	parameters:

		- Inactive color:	The color of the inactive segments
		- Active color:		The color of the active segments
		- Letter:			The current letter. You can change it just by editing the field. by script you can call: myDigit.letter = "X"
		- Force Lower:		If the letter is uppercase, the script will change it to lower. Otherwise, a and A can display different things

- Clock:
	A simple clock. You can make it display real or custom clock
	parameters:
	
		- realTime:			switch to real time display, or custom time
		- displayType:		A single clock can display 2 digits, and a single component of the time: hours, minuts, or seconds
		- Value:			The actual displayed Number
		- addValue:			Determines if the clock will run forward (1) or backward (-1)
		- Running:			the clock is running (checked) or not (unchecked)
		- Digit:			The 2 digits of the clock are referenced here
		- SecondCounter:	This field determines the seconds left between two steps. For example, when the displayType is set
							on hours, The secondCounter go through 0 to 3600 seconds. Then, the value increments.
		

- Bomb:
	You will find it in the folder of the same name. It is a ready to use Bomb. There is a script attached to it called CountDown.
	to start or stop the countdown any moment at runtime, call the functions:
	
		public void startCountDown(int hours, int minuts, int seconds);
		public void stopCountDown();
		
	You can also change the explosion instantiated by the bomb, just by dragging a new prefab in the field "Obj To Instantiate"

- AlarmClock:
	You will find it in the folder of the same name. it is just a model, with a clock in the children

- Display:
	You will find it in the folder of the same name. it a empty GameObject, with 16 children digit. On the GameObject, There is a
	script called Display. You can add extend the display just by adding new digits in the digit list. You can change the message
	displayed, just the field of the same name.
	at runtime, you can change it with :
	
		myDisplay.message = "Hello World";
